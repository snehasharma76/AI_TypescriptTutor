# TypeScript Curriculum Component - Product Requirements Document

## Overview

This document outlines the development approach, architecture, and design decisions for the TypeScript Curriculum Component created for Web3Compass. The component is a standalone, interactive UI that showcases a progressive learning path for TypeScript through five projects of increasing complexity.

## Project Vision

To create a visually appealing, interactive curriculum component that:
- Presents TypeScript learning content in a structured, progressive manner
- Allows users to explore topics within each project
- Clearly indicates which content is available and which is coming soon
- Maintains the Web3Compass brand identity with a retro-themed dark UI
- Can be easily integrated into the Web3Compass platform

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework**: React 18
- **Language**: TypeScript 5
- **Build Tools**: Webpack 5
- **Styling**: CSS3 with CSS Variables
- **Rendering**: Markdown-to-HTML conversion for content

## Component Architecture

### 1. Data Layer

The curriculum data is structured using TypeScript interfaces to ensure type safety:

```typescript
// Key interfaces
interface Project {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  difficulty: DifficultyLevel;
  topics: Topic[];
  available: boolean;
  githubUrl?: string;
}

interface Topic {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

enum DifficultyLevel {
  Beginner = "Beginner",
  Intermediate = "Intermediate",
  Advanced = "Advanced"
}
```

The data structure allows for:
- Hierarchical organization (Projects → Topics → Content)
- Metadata for each project (difficulty, availability)
- Optional GitHub links for available projects

### 2. Component Layer

The component architecture follows a modular approach:

```
App (Main Container)
└── ProjectCard (For each project)
    └── Topic Items (Expandable sections)
        └── Topic Content (Markdown rendered as HTML)
```

#### App Component
- Renders the overall curriculum container
- Maps through projects to render ProjectCard components
- Provides the header and footer elements

#### ProjectCard Component
- Handles the display of individual project cards
- Manages the state for expanded topics
- Renders "Coming Soon" badges for unavailable projects
- Provides GitHub links for available projects
- Converts markdown content to HTML for rendering

### 3. Styling Architecture

The styling uses CSS variables for theming and follows these principles:

- **Theme Variables**: Colors, spacing, and typography defined as CSS variables
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with media queries
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover and active states for better UX
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between available and upcoming content

The color scheme uses the Web3Compass retro theme:
- Retro Black (#111111) for backgrounds
- Retro White (#FFFEF2) for text
- Retro Yellow (#FFA726) for accents and interactive elements

## User Experience Design

### 1. Visual Design

The component follows the Web3Compass design system:
- Dark theme with high contrast for readability
- Retro yellow accents for interactive elements
- 8px border radius for UI elements
- Subtle glow effects on hover states
- Clear visual distinction between available and coming soon content

### 2. Interaction Design

- **Topic Expansion**: Users can click on topics to expand/collapse content
- **Visual Feedback**: Hover states provide immediate feedback
- **Content Hierarchy**: Clear visual distinction between projects, topics, and content
- **Accessibility**: High contrast colors and semantic HTML structure

### 3. Content Structure

Each project follows a consistent content structure:
1. Project title and description
2. Difficulty level indicator
3. List of topics with expandable content
4. GitHub repository link (if available)
5. "Coming Soon" indicator (if not available)

## Implementation Approach

### 1. Development Process

The development followed these steps:

1. **Setup**: Initialized a React TypeScript project with Webpack
2. **Data Modeling**: Defined TypeScript interfaces for curriculum data
3. **Component Development**: Created React components with state management
4. **Styling**: Implemented the Web3Compass design system
5. **Content Integration**: Added curriculum content with markdown support
6. **Testing**: Verified component functionality and responsiveness
7. **Documentation**: Created README and PRD for future reference

### 2. Key Technical Decisions

- **Markdown Rendering**: Used a simple regex-based approach to convert markdown to HTML for better content formatting
- **State Management**: Used React's useState hook for local component state
- **CSS Variables**: Implemented for easy theming and consistency
- **Standalone Architecture**: Designed to work independently from the main application

### 3. Challenges and Solutions

- **Challenge**: Rendering markdown content in React
  **Solution**: Implemented a custom markdown-to-HTML converter with regex patterns

- **Challenge**: Maintaining consistent styling with Web3Compass
  **Solution**: Used the exact color values from Web3Compass and implemented CSS variables

- **Challenge**: Creating expandable/collapsible sections
  **Solution**: Used React state to toggle visibility with smooth transitions

## Integration Options

The component can be integrated with Web3Compass in several ways:

### 1. Iframe Embedding

The simplest approach is to host the component separately and embed it via an iframe:

```html
<iframe 
  src="https://your-hosting-url.com/typescript-curriculum" 
  width="100%" 
  height="800px" 
  frameborder="0">
</iframe>
```

### 2. Direct Integration

For tighter integration, the component can be imported directly into the Web3Compass codebase:

```tsx
import TypeScriptCurriculum from './path/to/components/App';

// Then use it in your Web3Compass component
const YourComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Web3Compass Learning Paths</h1>
      <TypeScriptCurriculum />
    </div>
  );
};
```

### 3. NPM Package

For the most maintainable approach, the component could be published as an NPM package:

```bash
npm install web3compass-typescript-curriculum
```

```tsx
import { TypeScriptCurriculum } from 'web3compass-typescript-curriculum';

// Then use it in your application
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Content Management System**: Add a CMS interface for easier content updates
2. **User Progress Tracking**: Add functionality to track user progress through the curriculum
3. **Interactive Exercises**: Embed code playgrounds for hands-on learning
4. **Search Functionality**: Add search capability for finding specific topics
5. **Localization**: Support for multiple languages

## Conclusion

The TypeScript Curriculum Component provides a clean, interactive UI for presenting the TypeScript learning path on Web3Compass. Its modular design allows for easy integration and future enhancements, while its visual design aligns perfectly with the Web3Compass retro aesthetic.

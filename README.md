# TypeScript Learning Path

This repository contains a series of progressive TypeScript projects designed to help you master TypeScript from beginner to advanced levels. Each project builds upon the skills learned in the previous one, gradually introducing more complex concepts and real-world applications.

## Learning Approach

The projects in this repository follow a hands-on, practical approach to learning TypeScript. Each project:

- Focuses on specific TypeScript concepts
- Includes detailed documentation explaining the concepts used
- Provides step-by-step guides for implementation
- Offers opportunities for further enhancement and exploration

├── XX-Step-Name.md       # Detailed documentation for each step
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
└── package.json          # Project dependencies
```
